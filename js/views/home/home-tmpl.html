        <h4>Breast Cancer Awareness Month</h4>
        <p>
            October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which is an annual campaign to increase awareness of the disease. While most people are aware of breast cancer, many forget to take the steps to have a plan to detect the disease in its early stages and
            encourage others to do the same. We have made a lot of progress but still have a long way to go and need your help!
