I had originally thought the swelling was due to pregnancy and put off mentioning it to my doctor for months, but as it had rapidly grown in the preceding few weeks, I knew deep down it was something more.'

Many appointments and "fill ups" later, I had her exchange surgery in December of 2012. Next came the nipple reconstruction and fat grafting in March of 2013. During my many appointments with my plastic surgeon, I inquired about consulting with an areola tattoo specialist, but my plastic surgeon had no one to refer me to. I had searched for that "expert" and was unable to find a specialist.'
